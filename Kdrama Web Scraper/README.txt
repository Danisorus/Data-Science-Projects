Hi,

For this project I decided to create a web scraper for one of my favorite kdrama websites. 

It pulls from the list of shows the following data:
-The show title
-The latest episode number
-The date/time it was added
-Whether or not if the episode is subbed or in its raw language

In this file you will find two python program:
1) gives you a csv file of the full list of all the shows ever added to the site (denoted full-list)
2) gives the a csv file of the first pages on the site

If you do not want to run the program yourself that is totally fine. just open the two csv files to view the results

Thanks for taking the time to view my work! :)
